# Elea Health

## Inspiration + Story
My family is from rural India where there is a huge stigma for women to discuss reproductive health and menstraution. My cousins would hide their problems and feel discouraged to seek out the help they need. My group and I were inspired by a statistic we discovered which stated that 23 women drop out of school due to poor menstruation management. Many times the reluctance of women to seek a medical professional can lead to the health issue or problem worsening. Furthermore, in many developing countries, women do not always have access to adequate education about women’s health. We wanted to build a website to include important statistics to raise awareness about this issue and to allow users to take a quiz to check for common symptoms before being referred to a medical professional. For our logo, we wanted to show the unity between women. This is why we included a joint hand logo holding a heart to represent the need for change. We also named our company Elea after the Greek goddess of healing.

## What it does
Elea Health gives women the opportunity to learn more about their health and be informed. This is especially relevant for women in rural communities where reproductive health might be rarely talked about or even stigmatized. Sometimes, there is even distrust of the medical community, so it is important that these women are able to confidently learn about and understand their bodies themselves. We implemented a quiz for users to take if they are having certain issues that suggest a probable cause with the disclaimer to officially confirm with a doctor. Additionally, there is also a donate page, so users can contribute to causes for women’s health.

## How we built it
We used the platform Glitch to edit and host the website. We utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as our programming languages. We were also able to implement Bootstrap to assist with styling and jQuery to make the quiz portion. For the logo, there were many trials and errors. It was eventually hand drawn on the Procreate app using different layers and techniques. 

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a few challenges while creating Elea Health. We had to do a lot of research ourselves first. However, the quiz likely probably caused the most technical difficulties. We decided to build individual pages for each question, which took a long time. Depending on the answers, the page would eventually reveal a possible diagnosis with encouragement to talk to a doctor and link to learn more. However, now after all our hours of hard work, we are extremely satisfied with the results.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to implement a navigation bar for different pages on our website. We are also glad we added our logo to be our favicon as details were important to us. We included a quiz for users to check their symptoms and then be referred to additional resources. We added a carousel element to our home page as well as a database for users to search up popular women’s health care clinics in their location based on state. We used JavaScript to implement the search feature based on location.

## What we learned
When building the website, we tried new techniques in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We also learned how to implement special features such as a scalable navigation bar, embed pictures and videos, create quizzes, and search databases. 

## What's next for Elea Health
We will try to incorporate a Google Maps API so that the website can utilize the user’s current location to find nearby hospitals or health care centers. Additionally, another possible feature could be display outbreaks of diseases within the area. We would also like to utilize React to improve our performance and speed. React would also prevent repeating a lot of elements by creating reusable components. There are also tools we can implement to improve our SEO.
